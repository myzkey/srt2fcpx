JOHN enters the room quietly.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,800
JOHN
(whispering)
Is anyone home?

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,600
The house is eerily silent.
Only the clock ticks.

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,400
MARY (O.S.)
John? Is that you?

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,200
JOHN
Yeah, it's me.
Where are you?

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,000
MARY enters from the kitchen,
wiping her hands on a towel.

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,800
MARY
I was making dinner.
How was your day?

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,600
JOHN
Long. Really long.
I need to tell you something.

11
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,400
MARY
(concerned)
What is it?

12
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,200
JOHN
I got the promotion.

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,000
MARY
(excited)
Oh my God! Really?

14
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,800
JOHN
Really. We're moving to New York.

15
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,600
MARY
(pause)
When?

16
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,400
JOHN
Next month.

17
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,200
Mary sits down heavily.

18
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,000
MARY
Next month? But what about...

19
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,800
JOHN
What about what?

20
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,600
MARY
Everything. Our life here.

21
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,400
JOHN
This is our future, Mary.
Our chance.

22
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,200
MARY
I know, but...

23
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,000
The conversation continues...

24
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,800
FADE TO BLACK.

25
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,600
